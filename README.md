# One aMule Mod

aMule is a cross-platform eMule client, I guess you already know that.

This mode, the branch `mod`, has fixed some bugs in the official version:

- UPnP doesn't work, so when you are behind a router, you can't get a high ID using UPnP. 
But still, you can set port forwarding manually.
- With the shared files tab open, and remove all the shared files, aMule will crash.

_Some non-sense_

_eMule is a good software, so is aMule. However, honestly but sadly, it is about to die, if not dying._

_I didn't see much active development on aMule, because the patches were sent for long receiving no comment. 
And I don't use eMule/aMule as I used to be because it's hard to download files fast enough these days._

_So if you see a bug that fixed here but haven't fixed in the upstream (official aMule) yet. Please let me know. Thanks!_
